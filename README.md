In this code challenge we want to practice our basic knowledge on Javascript and how we navigate through Javascript
In this code challange we have three challanges we have to work on and test different applications of Java Script such as as loops,operational conditions etc
The challenges provided are stated as below;

  ~Creating a student's grade generator

  ~Creating a speed detector

  ~Net salary calculator


  #Creating a student's grade generator.

  In this challenge we shall use the (if statament) most preferably the (else if statement).

  For this challenge since we have multiple condions we shall use the (else if statement).

  below is a structure on how to go about the if statement:

  //if statement

  //syntax

  if(condition a){

    code if the condition is true

  }

  else if(condition 2){

    code if condition2 is true

    }

    else{

        code if neither the conditions given is true

    }

# Creating a speed detector

In this challenge we are to detect the speed of the car ,we have to write a program which shows if a driver exceeds the speed required what are the possible consequences he /she will have to face 
In this challange we will use the if statement
We set out constant speed of the car to be 70km/h
//syntax
function(){
    if(variablename = variable data){
        return " ";
    }
    const count = function();
    if(variablename > variable data){
        return " ";
    }
    return ` `;

}
